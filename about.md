# Hey!
**I am** a self taught programmer. I have done various online courses on computer science fundamentals (Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Operating Systems, Database Management System, Computer Networks, Software Engineering etc).

I love to solve puzzles and data structure problems. I have recently started practicing it with online resources like leetcode and codewars and I am willing to learn and work on new and emerging technologies which will ultimately help me to contribute to the industry and enhance my skills as a professional. 

I am currently pursuing "Networking and Internet security specialist" Course at CDI college, Montreal, Canada where I am learning to develop the network planning, implementation, administration skills.
