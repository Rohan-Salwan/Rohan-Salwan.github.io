# Hey Folks, This post is about my grind of becoming a software developer in short time span so lets begin with it.

**I am studying Networking and Internet security specialist course in CDI College**
So in this course i got interest into Cybersecurity then i research about it so i got that there are some tools which
hackers use to hack someoone and  then i study about those pentesting tools and eventually i got it that if someone 
wants to be a good ethical hacker then that person should be able to write those tools along with usage of existing tools 
so then i get it that i need to learn coding as well so it was a kind a twist in my life then i started learning about how
to code and its findamentals.
