# Hey Folks, actually i am a competitive gamer who loves to compete in games since childhood so I want to share my story with you guys that  how i become competitive gamer. 

**lets begin**
I was in high school when first time i exprienced multiplayer game Call of Duty which is very addictive and competitive so i loved that game alot because i have competitive nature. Although i played lot of competitive games earlier but it is unique because it has multiplayer exprience which connects players all over the world. Moreover, it has voice chat feature which helps to do audio chat simultaneously and these features attracted me alot so i started playing on daily basis and in couple of months i became a insane player because i was playing flawless. Then i thought i should try tournaments where i can enhance my gamig skills on another level and there will be chance to meet pro players too so then i participated in COD Asia Tournament where i played very well and some pro team members watched my gameplay and asked me for trials but i did not perform well because of high ping but eventually i got selected in COD pro team which was my dream so this how my professional gaming carrer started.
